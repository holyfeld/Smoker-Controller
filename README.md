Smoker Controller

I want to update the control system on my Masterbuilt MES-40. This smoker currently uses an Auber PID controller with a
thermistor probe in the smoker chamber. The 10A heating element plugs into the back of the Auber. The Auber uses a TPO
to control the on/off cycles which controls the chamber temp. Temperature set point is set via the front panel on the
Auber.

I've used various iGrill software for seeing/logging chamber and meat internal temperature. Data logging (for trends)
can be exported as a cvs file, and a PDF graph. Over time the # of temperature sensors increased (up to 4) with a
corresponding degradation of viewing trending. In fairness, I've not tried the new software on my iPad, only my iPhone.

Moving forward, the basic parts:

Raspberry PI, latest and greatest model
The ability to read 4 thermocouples. One will be for chamber temperature
(http://www.auberins.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=20_3&products_id=101),
the other three will be used for one or more meat internal temperatures.

Currently thinking a USB interface for this.

SSR for sending power to the chamber heating element (120VAC/1200W).
http://www.robotshop.com/en/40a-ssr-relay.html or
http://www.auberins.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=393
Or maybe a 0 - 5 output to fire the Auber SSR so I donâ€™t have to mess with the TPO calculations.
(Future) a local touch screen interface similar to https://www.adafruit.com/products/2395
Some interface plate to allow access to the GPIO for firing the SSR (#3) and interfacing to the (future) touch screen.
Power supply
Terminal strip(s).
An enclosure for mounting the above stuff.

And the functions:

Set and view the desired smoker chamber temperature.
Control to the set temperature. Initially we will focus only on steady state temperatures, no ramp/soak.
View controller output (0 - 100%).
View controller tuning parameters.
Set controller tuning parameters.
View controller Auto / Manual state.
Set controller Auto / Manual state.
View (up to 4) temperature inputs.
Assign names to each of the 4 thermocouple inputs for logging and trending purposes,
Allow a name to be entered for storing the trend data.
Displaying the trend data.
View alarms?
Set alarms?
Emergency conditions?
Clean exit (shut down all outputs). Which begs a question, can this be set up fail safe, or is that implicit as when
the RPi loses power, the SSR will (should?) lose power also.



ToDos: research PID loops with TPO.
